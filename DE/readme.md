# Source code for simple differential evolution (DE)
The DE algorithm is implemented with the  [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language (version 1.5.0 or higher). We write the code in [ Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) for enhanced readability. Some technical details are also explained in the notebook.
## Overview of files in the *src* directory
- models.jl: 

Julia code in a text file that defines the single- and double- diode models as well as functions to compute the SSE and RMSE. These functions are used in the notebook below.
- DE.ipynb

Julia code written with Jupyter notebook that produces all DE results and figures in our paper.
- The *data* subfolder contains the two benchmark datasets.

## How to view the code files online
You can view these files directly on GitHub just by clicking them, e.g., the pretty notebook  [DE.ipynb](./src/DE.ipynb) and the associated results generated by the code therein.
## How to run the code locally
1. Make sure that you have the Julia language (version >= 1.5.0) and the [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) kernel for Jupyter notebook installed.
2. Download or clone this [rePVest](https://github.com/ShuhuaGao/rePVest) repository into your local PC.
3. Change into the *rePVest* root folder and launch the Julia REPL there.
4. Instantiate the Julia environment as specified by our *Project.toml*  and *Manifest.toml* by typing the following command in Julia REPL
```julia-repl
]instantiate
```
During the instantiation process, all required packages will be installed automatically.

5. In another terminal like Windows PowerShell, change into the *DE/src* subfolder , and launch Jupyter notebook by `jupyter notebook`. Then the notebook file`DE.ipynb` can be opened and run there. 

(You may also follow the instructions given by [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) to start the Jupyter notebook.)
